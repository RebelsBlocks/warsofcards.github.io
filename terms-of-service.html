            <h1>Terms of Service — Wars of Cards</h1>

            <p>We run a small card game on NEAR at <strong>warsofcards.online</strong>. It's an MVP—no company, no legal department.</p>

            <p><strong>If you use the site, connect a wallet, or touch our contracts, you accept this. Otherwise don't use it.</strong></p>

            <h2>Who can use it</h2>
            <p>You need a NEAR wallet. You're responsible for it and for your local laws.</p>

            <h2>What it is</h2>
            <p>A skill-based card game on NEAR (blackjack live; more games planned). Not a casino, not financial advice, not regulated gambling. CARDS are in-game utility—<strong>no value</strong>, not currency, we don't buy them back. <strong>You own the CARDS you hold.</strong> We're not responsible for them: what you do (use, sell, trade) is your choice and your risk—including getting scammed. Pack purchases are final. Product in development, provided "as is."</p>

            <h2>Wallet & chain</h2>
            <p>We never see your keys or hold your assets. You sign; you're responsible for checking txs and having gas. On-chain is irreversible. Contracts can have bugs; use at your own risk.</p>

            <h2>Liability</h2>
            <p>No warranties. We're not liable for your losses, CARDS, scams, wallet issues, network failures, or what anyone does with CARDS. We're a small project; liability is limited to what law allows.</p>
