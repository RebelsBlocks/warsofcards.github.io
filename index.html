                    <li><strong>Play Your Hand</strong> — Make hit/stand decisions when it's your turn</li>
                    <li><strong>Collect Winnings</strong> — If you win, tokens are added to your balance automatically</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Step 5: Explore and Learn</h3>
