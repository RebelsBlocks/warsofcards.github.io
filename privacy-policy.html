            <h1>Privacy Policy — Wars of Cards</h1>

            <p><strong>We collect the minimum we need to run the game.</strong> Your NEAR wallet = your identity. We don't ask for email or passwords. We don't sell your data. CARDS in your wallet are yours; we never have custody.</p>

            <h2>What we have</h2>
            <p>Wallet address when you connect. On-chain stuff (balances, txs)—that's already public on NEAR. Gameplay (results, leaderboard, session) so the game works. Basic tech (browser, IP) for the app and real-time play. If you contact us, we keep that. Optional: display name, profile. We don't do KYC, don't see your keys, don't use ad trackers on other sites.</p>

            <h2>What we do with it</h2>
            <p>Run the game, leaderboards, in-game lore from gameplay context (not your personal data). Fix bugs, improve. Security and enforcing our terms. We use normal hosting; we don't sell. We only hand data over if the law says we must.</p>

            <h2>On-chain = permanent</h2>
            <p>We can't delete blockchain data. Off-chain we keep while you use the site and for a bit after. You can ask us to delete off-chain data (contact via site). In the EU you have the usual rights (access, correction, erasure where possible); contact us to use them.</p>

            <h2>Storage</h2>
            <p>We don't set cookies. The app and your wallet (e.g. NEAR) may use <strong>local storage</strong> in your browser for session and wallet connection—that's stored on your device, not sent to us as "cookie" tracking. No third-party ads or cross-site tracking. Wallet providers have their own policies.</p>
